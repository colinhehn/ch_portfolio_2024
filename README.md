# C TRAIN PORTFOLIO
Just gonna use this README to figure out wtf to do with the site, like TODO, potential features, packages to use, where to find other versions (because I want to hold onto the COMING SOON format while also making an ACTUAL portfolio), etc.

hopefully I set the domain DNS records correctly, we'll see in a few hours lol

## TODO
- Add favicon so it's not just blank...
- Add linktree hyperlink at the bottom of the page. That way they can access all my socials and stuff despite this portfolio being unfinished.
- Loading animation. Don't want page to load before video is loaded, or have excessive load time with no output. Needs to show user that they made it to the site, just that the video is loading.
- Dope ass animations. When the loading screen ends, do some sort of fade/wipe/etc. Maybe something when you hover over the linktree at the bottom.
- Get a CDN for background video... Can YouTube do BG video? who knows. If not, try Google drive, then maybe vimeo, something like that.
