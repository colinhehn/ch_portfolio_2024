# C TRAIN PORTFOLIO
Just gonna use this README to figure out wtf to do with the site, like TODO, potential features, packages to use, where to find other versions (because I want to hold onto the COMING SOON format while also making an ACTUAL portfolio), etc.

## TODO
- Loading animation. Don't want page to load before video is loaded, or have excessive load time with no output. Needs to show user that they made it to the site, just that the video is loading.
- Dope ass animations. When the loading screen ends, do some sort of fade/wipe/etc. Maybe something when you hover over the linktree at the bottom.
- New favicon im kinda done with that picture lol
- Make the new fuckin site man lord have mercy
